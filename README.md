# Biometric Sample

A sample implementation of the androidx biometric compat lib with all the workarounds needed for a
production app. `MainActivity.kt` includes the logic to show the biometric prompt both at startup
and on the click of a button. `Cyrpto.kt` handles encrypting and decrypting data using asymmetric
encryption. Both are heavily commented.
